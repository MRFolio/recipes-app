### Motivation

The main motivation with this project was to try out **Typescript**. I felt that the overall complexity level was just right to do so. I decided to use **Redux Toolkit** for the first time as well. I also knew I wanted make a project related to food and I found [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php 'TheMealDB homepage') that fit the bill almost perfectly.

### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
