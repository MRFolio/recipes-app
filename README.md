### Motivation

I desired to learn and practice **Typescript**. I felt that the overall complexity level of the project was just right to try out TS. I decided to use **Redux Toolkit** for the first time as well. I wanted to make a project related to food, and I discovered [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php 'TheMealDB homepage') that had a lot of interesting data available.

### Technologies used:

- **ReactJS**
- **TypeScript**
- **SCSS**
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Router** for routing

### Challenges:

Biggest hurdle was in the beginning with all the setup, and getting accustomed to writing everything in TypeScript (TS). I got constantly screamed at by long-winded TS errors, which was rather intimidating at first. For educational purposes, I tried to steer away from using any types to ease out of trouble.

I realized that just calmly reading the error messages was the best solution to the situation, and TS did start to grow on me as I got more used to thinking on that level. I know more practice is needed for me to be fully comfortable with TS, but I am glad I chose to take the first step.
